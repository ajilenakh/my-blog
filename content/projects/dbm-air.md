## DBM Air: Your Flight Booking Companion

DBM Air began as a college assignment, but it quickly turned into a collaborative project fueled by curiosity and a desire to learn. My friend and I set out to build a functional flight booking website, which became our first real step into web development.

### About the Project

The website is designed to simplify the flight booking experience. Although we were new to coding, this project became a hands-on opportunity to apply and expand our knowledge. We created:

- **Frontend**: Built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript for a clean, responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Developed with PHP to handle the core functionalities.
- **Database**: MySQL was used to manage flight data, user records, and bookings.

### Hosting and Deployment

Initially, the website was hosted locally, but we explored hosting solutions and eventually deployed it using Hostinger. After discovering Docker, we transitioned to a containerized environment, making the setup more reliable and scalable.

### Features

- Search and book flights based on destinations and dates.
- User-friendly interface for seamless navigation.
- Dynamic data retrieval for available flights.
- Basic user authentication for managing bookings.

### Challenges and Growth

This project taught us about coding best practices, debugging, and deployment workflows.
