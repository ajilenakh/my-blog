## Overview

This project involves setting up a **Spring Boot application** to automate the **CI/CD pipeline** for deploying a Java web application. The goal is to simplify the development, deployment, and management process by integrating version control, automated builds, testing, and deployments, while leveraging modern DevOps practices. This approach eliminates the need for complex server setups by packaging everything into a self-contained **JAR file**, including the **embedded Tomcat** server, and using automated deployment workflows.

### Current Status

The Spring Boot application is set up, and the next steps focus on automating the **CI/CD pipeline** for continuous integration, testing, and deployment. The pipeline will be designed to streamline updates, handle different environments, and improve the development cycle.

### To-Do List

1. **Decide on the Application**  
   Identify the type of Java web application to develop (e.g., a simple blog, task manager, or REST API).

2. **Version Control**  
   Host the application code on GitHub for collaborative development and version tracking.

3. **JAR File Creation**  
   Build the application and package it as a **JAR (Java ARchive)** file. Since Spring Boot includes an **embedded Tomcat** server, this JAR file will contain everything needed to run the application, including the server.

4. **Deployment**  
   Deploy the JAR file directly to the server (e.g., EC2 instance, cloud server, or local server) and run it using the `java -jar` command. The embedded Tomcat server will automatically start when the application is run.

5. **Automation Setup**  
   Automate deployment workflows using tools like **Jenkins**, **GitHub Actions**, or a custom script. The goal is to ensure that every time there is a change in the codebase, the application is automatically built, tested, and deployed to the appropriate environment.

6. **Multi-Environment Setup**  
   - Set up configurations for different environments such as **Development (Dev)**, **Quality Assurance (QA)**, and **Production (Prod)**.
   - Use Spring Boot profiles to manage environment-specific settings (e.g., database URLs, API keys, etc.).

7. **CI/CD Pipeline**  
   - Integrate continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices for seamless updates and testing.
   - The pipeline should automate building, testing, and deploying the application with minimal manual intervention.

### Future Improvements

- **Monitoring and Logs**: Set up monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track server health and application performance. Configure logging for better error tracking and debugging.
- **Load Balancing**: Explore solutions for distributing traffic across multiple instances of the application, ensuring better performance and fault tolerance.
- **Scaling**: Test horizontal scaling by adding more instances of the application, either on-premises or using cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
