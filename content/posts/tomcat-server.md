## Overview

This project involves setting up a **Tomcat server** for hosting and deploying a simple Java web application. The server has been installed and configured on my local machine, following this [comprehensive guide](https://www.atlantic.net/dedicated-server-hosting/how-to-install-tomcat-on-arch-linux/). The goal is to create a robust pipeline for developing, deploying, and managing Java web applications with automation and multiple environment support.

### Current Status

The Tomcat server is up and running on my local machine. Next steps involve creating and deploying a Java web application while planning for scalability and testing in different environments.

### To-Do List

1. **Decide on the Application**  
   Identify the type of Java web application to develop (e.g., a simple blog, task manager, or REST API).

2. **Version Control**  
   Host the application code on GitHub for collaborative development and version tracking.

3. **WAR File Creation**  
   Build the application and package it as a **WAR (Web Application Archive)** file.

4. **Deployment**  
   Deploy the WAR file on the Tomcat server and test its functionality.

5. **Automation Setup**  
   Automate deployment workflows using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or a custom script.

6. **Multi-Environment Setup**  
   - Create a second Tomcat server instance on a different host.
   - Designate the current server as the **Development (Dev)** environment and the second instance as the **Quality Assurance (QA)** environment.

7. **CI/CD Pipeline**  
   Integrate continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices for seamless updates and testing.

### Future Improvements

- **Monitoring and Logs**: Set up monitoring tools to track server health and application performance.
- **Load Balancing**: Explore load balancers to distribute traffic across servers efficiently.
- **Scaling**: Test horizontal scaling by adding more servers or transitioning to a cloud-based solution.

This document will be updated as I complete each step. Feedback or suggestions for improvement are always welcome!
