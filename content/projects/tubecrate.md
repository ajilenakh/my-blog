## TubeCrate: Simplifying Video Downloads

TubeCrate was born out of necessity. Finding a reliable website to download HD videos with audio in .mp4 format can be surprisingly difficult. This project aims to solve that problem by creating a streamlined solution for downloading videos efficiently and conveniently.

### About the Project

TubeCrate focuses on providing a user-friendly API for downloading videos with high-quality audio. While the backend functionality is robust, the frontend is still in progressâ€”a task that, admittedly, feels less exciting but remains essential for a complete user experience.

### Features

- **Video Downloading**: Supports downloading videos in .mp4 format with integrated audio.
- **High-Quality Options**: Allows users to fetch videos in HD and other resolutions.
- **API-Driven Architecture**: The core functionality is exposed through a clean and efficient API.
- **Docker Hosting**: The backend API is containerized using Docker, making deployment and scalability simple.

### Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Built with Python for efficient and scalable API development.
- **Deployment**: Hosted in a Docker container for easy setup and consistent performance.
- **Frontend** *(in progress)*: A user-friendly interface is being developed to complement the powerful backend.

### Challenges and Growth

This project has been a journey of learning and problem-solving. From understanding video processing to deploying a containerized API, TubeCrate reflects my growth in handling real-world development tasks.

### Future Plans

- Completing and launching the frontend to make the platform accessible to non-technical users.
- Adding support for additional file formats and resolutions.
- Implementing a queue system for handling large-volume downloads efficiently.
