## Introduction

off the rip this just me trying to get my hands dirty with the devops world this project marks the begning of actively learning devops. So first of all i made a laoyout for building a book library web application using spring the idea was user can searh books and read them form the database and admins can upload books. After which i made a git repo and created one brach development making two branches master default for production and another development for dev. then i host an instacne of jenkins on my local machine to automate the deployment process although deploying a spring boot web appinst that tidius but still just to learn.

## Jenkins Setup
setting jenking was not that complicated. I would suggest read the jenkins documentation but i followed this [guide](https://www.atlantic.net/dedicated-server-hosting/how-to-install-jenkins-on-arch-linux/) for setting on my arch.
after that i created a user  and installed the nessary plugins
i setup up credintials for github and [[static/images/cicd/cicd.png]]
