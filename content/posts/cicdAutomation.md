At this stage, I don't have much experience with DevOps. My previous experience mainly involves using Docker to host multiple servers and setting up VPNs to play LAN games with my friends. Recently, I decided to dive deeper into DevOps by automating the deployment of a simple web application.

I designed a basic layout for an online library web application. Then, I created a development branch in GitHub and configured two `application.properties` files for different environmentsâ€”one for development and one for production. After that, I pushed the code to GitHub and set up a local Jenkins instance on my machine to automate the deployment process. I deployed two instances of the web application, each corresponding to one of the branches.
